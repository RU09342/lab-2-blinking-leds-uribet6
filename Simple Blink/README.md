# Simple Blink
For starters, you will need to blink one of the on-board LED's at a particular rate. It is up to you to determine what rate you want to blink it at, however it has to be symmetrical (50% Duty Cycle), meaning equal times on and off. You should attempt multiple different speeds before moving on to the next part of the lab.

## README
Remember to replace this README with your README once you are ready to submit. I would recommend either making a copy of this file or taking a screen shot. There might be a copy of all of these README's in a folder on the top level depending on the exercise.

## Extra Work
Since this is so basic, there are a few things which might be interesting to implement.

### UART Control: Single Character
For starters, it would be interesting to tie in some of the UART code that was used before into this project. You might want to have the speed of the blinking controlled by a character sent over UART. For example, 's' could be a slow setting, 'm' could be medium speed, 'f' could be fast, and 'o' could be off.

### UART Control: Rate Number
Instead of depending on a character, what if we wanted to send a blinking period in milliseconds? So instead of 's', you could send something like '100' which corresponds to a 100 millisecond delay between the time the LED turns on again. Before you decide to tackle this, I would take a look at using a logic analyzer to see exactly what your computer is sending to your microprocessor. Also remember that the code previously provided will only service the UART Buffer one character at a time.
